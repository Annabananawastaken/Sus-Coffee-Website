                    Welcome to our website about the coffee production chain. Our goal is to inform readers about how unsustainable the coffee production chain is and compare it to a sustainable one. In the end, we also show you some sustainable brands that you can look for in stores to make an impact.
                    The idea is that you scroll through the website and it takes you through all the steps in the coffee supply chain. During the website there will be clickable icons where you can find more information about the specific topic.
